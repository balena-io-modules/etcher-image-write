Installation

```

Documentation

### imageWrite.write(drive, image, options) â‡’ <code>EventEmitter</code>
**NOTICE:** You might need to run this function as sudo/administrator to
avoid permission issues.

The returned EventEmitter instance emits the following events:

- `progress`: A progress event that passes a state object of the form:

```js
{
  type: 'write' // possible values: 'write', 'check'.
  percentage: 9.05,
  transferred: 949624,
  length: 10485760,
  remaining: 9536136,
  eta: 10,
  runtime: 0,
  delta: 295396,
  speed: 949624
}
```

- `error`: An error event.
- `done`: An event emitted with a boolean success value.

Enabling the `check` option is useful to ensure the image was
successfully written to the device. This is checked by calculating and
comparing checksums from both the original image and the data written
to the device.

The `transform` option is used to handle cases like decompression of
an image on the fly. The stream is piped through this transform stream
*after* the progress stream and *before* any writing and alignment.

This allows the progress to be accurately displayed even when the
client doesn't know the final uncompressed size.

For example, to handle writing a compressed file, you pass the
compressed stream to `.write()`, pass the *compressed stream size*,
and a transform stream to decompress the file.

**Kind**: static method of <code>[imageWrite](#module_imageWrite)</code>  
**Summary**: Write a readable stream to a device  
**Returns**: <code>EventEmitter</code> - emitter  
**Access:** public  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| drive | <code>Object</code> |  | drive |
| drive.device | <code>String</code> |  | drive device |
| drive.size | <code>Number</code> |  | drive size |
| image | <code>Object</code> |  | image |
| image.stream | <code>ReadStream</code> |  | image readable stream |
| image.size | <code>Number</code> |  | image stream size |
| options | <code>Object</code> |  | options |
| [options.transform] | <code>TransformStream</code> |  | transform stream |
| [options.check] | <code>Boolean</code> | <code>false</code> | enable write check |
| [options.bmap] | <code>String</code> |  | bmap file contents |

**Example**  
```js
var emitter = imageWrite.write({
  device: '/dev/disk2',
  size: 2014314496
}, {
  stream: fs.createWriteStream('my/image'),
  size: fs.statSync('my/image').size
}, {
  check: true
});

emitter.on('progress', function(state) {
  console.log(state);
});

emitter.on('error', function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});

emitter.on('done', function(results) {
  if (results.passedValidation) {
    console.log('Success!');
  } else {
    console.log('Failed!');
  }
});
```
